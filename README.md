# Short pitch
## Pain
Traditional centralized crowdsourcing platforms are only available to people of certain countries. They also require users to comply with the KYC process. That makes them permissible. The trust also must be placed to these centralized platforms. Their business model requires fees of up to 10% per transaction. The early bird contributors to the project can't trade with the potential rewards that they had purchased.
